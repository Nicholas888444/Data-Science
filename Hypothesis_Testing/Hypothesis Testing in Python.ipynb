    "**What is Hypothesis Testing?**\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population parameter based on sample data. It involves two competing hypotheses: the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1). The goal is to determine whether the observed data provide enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts**\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The default assumption that there is no significant difference or effect.\r\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis and suggests a significant difference or effect.\r\n",
    "- **Test Statistic**: A numerical summary of the sample data used to assess the likelihood of observing the data under the null hypothesis.\r\n",
    "- **P-value**: The probability of observing the test statistic or more extreme values under the null hypothesis. A small p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. s. ."
